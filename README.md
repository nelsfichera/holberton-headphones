# Recreating a design from wireframes
Using PDF found in the root of this file, which contains wireframes made by a UI/UX designer, recreate the design using any method you see fit. 
No Javascript may be used, nor any CSS framework such as Bootstrap. 

<ul> <li> The webpage must switch to mobile at >= 480px. </li>
<li>Links will change color on hover and when active. </li>
<li> Buttons will change opacity on hover and when active. </li>
<li>The maximum width of content will be 1000px. </li>
<li> Pentagons should be drawn with code in the final result. </li> 
<li> Animations may be added to "What we do..." and "Our results" sections. </li>
<li> A final SASS version of the CSS may be produced when CSS has been fully generated. </li>
<ul>
