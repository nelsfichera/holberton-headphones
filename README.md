# Recreating a design from wireframes
Using PDF found in the root of this file, which contains wireframes made by a UI/UX designer, recreate the design using any method you see fit. 
No Javascript may be used, nor any CSS framework such as Bootstrap. 

## The webpage must switch to mobile at >= 480px.
## Links will change color on hover and when active.
## Buttons will change opacity on hover and when active.
## The maximum width of content will be 1000px.
## Pentagons should be drawn with code in the final result. 
## Animations may be added to "What we do..." and "Our results" sections
## A final SASS version of the CSS may be produced when CSS has been fully generated.
